### What is EthChat?
EthChat is a secure distributed chat client running on the Ethereum blockchain. EthChat leverages Smart Contracts to create a chat application without a central server. Messages sent to the blockchain cannot be modified or faked, ensuring complete security.

### What technologies does EthChat use?
The EthChat smart contract is built using Solidity. This contract is currently running on the Ethereum blockhain and functions as the backend. The frontend is written using AngularJS, jQuery, Javascript, HTML, and CSS.

### Installation Instructions
To run EthChat yourself, host the static web files and navigate to the index. If you want to try hosting EthChat on your localhost, you can use https://github.com/indexzero/http-server to test it out. EthChat requires that MetaMask is installed in order to query the blockchain. A live example of Ethchat can be found at https://austenke.github.io/EthChat/.

### About me
I am a student at Northeastern University studying Computer Science. I have had a passion for programming and technology since middle school. I am particularly interested in full stack development and have worked in this capacity at companies such as Amazon Robotics and Sauce Labs. I built this chat client in order to teach myself about Ethereum and the blockchain.
